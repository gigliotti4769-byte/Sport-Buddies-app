# Phase 2 Visual Lock

## Purpose
This document establishes the visual lock for Phase 2 development. During Phase 2, we focus exclusively on functional wiring and backend integration. No visual, layout, or styling changes are permitted unless directly required to connect functionality.

## Rules

### ❌ NOT ALLOWED (unless functionally required)
- CSS/Tailwind class changes
- Component layout refactors
- Animation or motion changes
- Color scheme adjustments
- Typography changes
- Spacing or sizing modifications
- New visual components or redesigns

### ✅ ALLOWED (functional wiring only)
- Adding event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- Wiring modal triggers and state management
- Adding data fetching hooks
- Connecting backend mutations
- Adding conditional rendering based on data state
- Adding loading/error states using existing patterns

## Examples

### ✅ Good: Adding a click handler
